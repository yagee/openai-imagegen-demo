This repo contains a simple photobooth demo built with Next.js that lets you capture or upload a portrait and create multiple image styles using the [OpenAI Image API](https://developers.openai.com/api/reference/resources/images/methods/edit) in edit mode with the [GPT Image 2 model](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-image-2).

Learn more about image generation and see examples in our [dedicated guide](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/image-generation).
